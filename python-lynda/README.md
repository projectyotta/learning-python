Everything on the Up and Running with Python course by Joe Marini on Lynda.com 
This is basically everything on the Up and Running with Python course by Joe Marini - https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Up-Running-Python/

I've tried to work on everything on the course , but I *might* have missed a few things. 

Next step : try to work on a realtime project using these skills.
